                    <h2 class="mb-5">Personal Statement</h2>
                    <p>My primary interests within the field are Interaction design and user research. In my opinion, these disciplines go hand in hand because you have to have a solid understanding of the user’s behavior and habits in order to understand how to design and optimize their interaction with a specific product or service. I have always been fascinated with the integration of clever design decisions into common, everyday products..</p>
                    Although I am just getting started with my degree at the University, I am starting to learn what skills I have that separate me from my peers and what things I need to develop during my time here. My sustainable design class has opened my eyes to a world of sustainable innovation and I have already began a project focused on redesigning components for products with a sustainable, yet practical purpose. <br>
                   <br> As a professional I would like to collaborate with creative minds to innovate technological products/solutions that can leave a lasting impression on people and further motivate the next generation of designers. I believe that concurrent design is derived from the excellence of past designers and I hope to set a similar blueprint for those that come after me. <br>
                    <br> One experience that I think aligns with my interest in this field happened two years ago (before I was even in the program), where my friend (industrial designer at WWU) and I drafted and created a prototype for a wood carrying backpack that solved an issue that we had been having for a while. We are both wilderness enthusiasts and had a common hiking spot where we would set up hammocks and make campfires. The backpack idea came about because of our struggles with carrying bundles of wood up to our campsite. We researched the topic of wood carrying backpacks and were not only able to execute a functional prototype but we also learned a lot about what goes into the design process, and the patience and research that goes into a project like that.

                    <br>
                    <div class="subheading mb-0">Introduction</div>

                    My team's first action addressing this issue was to research the impact that old and unused chargers were having on the environment in terms of their annual global emissions.
                    Finding that chargers attributed to a significant number of global emissions, I conducted a life cycle analysis on the product and drafted survey questions to study how people were addressing the end of life stage of their chargers. 
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="subheading mb-0">Methods & Data Collection</div>
                    - Interviews: Here we focused on gathering in-depth insights from individual users to help guide our survey questions. <br>
                    - Surveys: We wanted more data about user behavior regarding how they reycle and dispose of e-waste. Larger sample size. <br>
                    - Online Sources: What is already out there that is similar to what we are proposing?
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="subheading mb-0">Research Findings</div>
                    - Our research estimated that Apple USB-C charger e-waste globally produces around 297.5 million pounds of GHG per year, which is equivalent to the emissions from the electricity use of 5,593 homes for one year. <br>
                    - Through our surveys and interviews, we discovered that most people either lacked awareness of the true impact chargers have on overall e-waste, or lacked the motivation to go through a recycling process without any incentive. <br><br>
                    <div class="subheading mb-0">Prototype</div>
                    we proposed packaging with a prepaid mail-back envelope for easy at-home recycling (for convenience) and a discount on select services to increase participation and awareness.
